# Todo List RESTful API
This is the REST API to organize all your tasks and their status whether it is pending, ongoing or completed. Uses MongoDB database to store the data. Deploy it locally inside containers.

## Deploy
### Inside the container.

1. Clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/yash-saini275/todo_list_api
```

2. Go to the root of repository.
```
cd todo_list_api
```

3. Use **docker-compose** command to build and run the container
    * Build the image
    ```
    docker-compose build
    ```

    * Run the image
    ```
    docker-compose up
    ```

This will start the API and MongoDB server inside the container. Use **Postman** to send requests to the API endpoints.
